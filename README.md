# Prateek for Unity

## The library that is very 'pratique'

### Usage

For a more detailed usage, imgui_demo.cpp.txt is available at the root of the repo

- [Add package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html) From this dear imgui integration: https://github.com/touky/dear-imgui-unity.git#v1.78.1
- - v1.78.1 is the most recent and supported version
- - At the moment, Prateek fully relies on dear imgui and requires that integration to compile.
- - This is a manual process, because unity does not handle package dependencies from git URL
- [Add package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html) from this git URL: https://github.com/touky/Prateek.git#v1.0.1
- - v1.0.1 is the most recent and supported version
