- - At the moment, Prateek fully relies on dear imgui and requires that integration to compile.
- - This is a manual process, because unity does not handle package dependencies from git URL
- [Add package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html) from this git URL: https://github.com/touky/Prateek.git
